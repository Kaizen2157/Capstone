    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>1. How does the parking reservation system work?</h3>
      <p>
        Our system allows users to check available parking slots in real-time, reserve a slot for a specific date and time, and pay directly using their account balance. Once reserved, the system automatically updates the slot status and controls the gate and slot indicators.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>2. How do I create an account?</h3>
      <p>
        Simply visit our registration page, fill in your details, and create an account. Once registered, you can load a balance and start reserving parking slots.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>3. How can I check if a parking slot is available?</h3>
      <p>
        You can view real-time slot availability on the dashboard after logging in. Slots are updated based on live sensor data and other users' reservations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>4. Can I reserve a parking slot that overlaps with another reservation?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, but only if the time does not conflict. Multiple users can reserve the same slot as long as their start and end times do not overlap.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>5. How do I pay for a reservation?</h3>
      <p>
        You can load funds into your account through the admin or payment process (depending on deployment). The system automatically deducts the cost from your balance when you confirm a reservation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>6. What happens if I overstay beyond my reservation time?</h3>
      <p>
        If you overstay, the system will automatically deduct a penalty fee from your account balance. This ensures fairness for all users.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>7. Can I cancel my reservation?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, you can cancel your reservation before your start time. Cancellation policies may apply, and refunds depend on system rules.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>8. What happens if I reserve but don't use the slot?</h3>
      <p>
        If the slot isn't occupied within the allowed grace period, the system may auto-cancel your reservation without a refund to ensure fair usage for others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>9. How do the gates and slot indicators work?</h3>
      <p>
        Our Arduino-powered hardware automatically controls the entry gate and LED indicators based on your reservation status. The gate opens when a valid reservation is detected, and slot LEDs change colors to indicate availability, reservation, or occupancy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>10. Is my personal data safe?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. We prioritize your privacy and data security. Our system is designed with secure backend processes to protect your information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
